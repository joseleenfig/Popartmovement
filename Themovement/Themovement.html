    <h1>The Pop Art Movement</h1>
    <img src="images/wowart.png" alt="Pop Art">
   <p>The Pop Art movement was born in Britain in the 1950s, from a young artist group who called themselves 
    the Independent group. The group started a new movement around the world, with this new art. 
    Pop Art was the start of something new for graffiti, comic books, cartoons and more.
    This new art didn't focus on making art realistic, in fact art became more of an imaginary world.<br>
